# MidtermProject

## Overview
	User is welcomed to Stacktrace Space Station website, where users will see what we are about and have the option to sign up or sign in.

	Once a user is signed in they can update their profile, view a list of space objects, or add to the space object list. As well as add comments on their favorite space objects.

	Users can add a list of their own observations/Encounter of space, with image urls, and tracking urls. Users can also view other users profiles and rate other users Encounters. 

	Users can edit, add, and remove their own comments from all encounters. Users can also view an individual space object and explore all the image that every user uploaded from their experiences.

## Lessons Learned

	How important it is to understand the relationship between the objects in the database, the entities, and how to relate them to eachother.

	Having a good team dinamic, being ok with playing your strenths and improving your weaknesses.

	Linking database tables and rows to creating entities and linking the field's of each entity to the other entities. 

	Mapping was easy to mess up fast, but this project helped iron out mapping between the .jsp's and the controllers.
